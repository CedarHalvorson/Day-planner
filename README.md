# Day-planner
# 05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler
I created the day planner by first placing all of the blocks to enter your information and labeling them hours 8:00 - 16:00 (thats 8:00am to 4:00pm regular time).
I then added the current date and time to the top of the page and created a function containing a for loop and if statements that recognize the time of day and display different colors baced on the time of day.
